Comment: 'Try an airplane next time'
Sentiment: 'It is a bit difficult to determine the sentiment of a sentence that doesn't give much context.

The sentence "Try an airplane next time" can be either a friendly recommendation to make it more enjoyable for users on their next trip. For example, if someone had a terrible experience on a bus, their friend might suggest "Try an airplane next time". But this sentence can also be said in a condescending, arrogant tone, making the sentiment negative.

Given the context that the user said this while responding to the sentence "the bus rides are always packed and uncomfortable", there are two possible interpretations.

Here are some possible explanations for the sentence and their sentiments:

* If the speaker truly means it to be helpful, then the sentence probably has a positive sentiment.
* If the speaker tries to mock the "bus" rider and promote traveling by air, then it could have a negative sentiment.

In some cases, the speaker might use it to compare "plane" riders (rich people) with "bus" riders (poor people), hence the sentence may convey a feeling of superiority, making it negative.

Therefore, I think it would be wise to ask the speaker's true intention before determining the sentiment of the sentence.

Comment: 'If you're going to steal a bus, make sure it's a double decker... Some people wanna have a smoke.'
Sentiment: 'It is difficult to determine the sentiment of the sentence, "If you're going to steal a bus, make sure it's a double decker... Some people wanna have a smoke." 

One interpretation is that the speaker is being humorous and lighthearted. This is because the sentence is suggesting that the only reason to steal a bus is to be able to smoke on the top deck. This is a silly and ridiculous reason to steal a bus, and it suggests that the speaker is not serious about committing this crime.

However, it is also possible that the speaker is being serious. If the speaker is serious, then the sentence is suggesting that they are planning to steal a bus. This is a serious crime, and it is likely that the speaker would be arrested if they were caught.

Therefore, it is unclear whether the speaker is being serious or not. Without more context, it is impossible to say for sure what the sentiment of the sentence is.'

Therefore, the overall sentiment of the sentence is negative, despite the attempted use of humor.'
