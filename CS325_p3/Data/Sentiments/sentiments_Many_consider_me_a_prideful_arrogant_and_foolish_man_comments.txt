Comment: 'You consider yourself to be the most humble person ever.'
Sentiment: 'It is difficult to say for sure what the sentiment of this sentence is. The word "humble" can be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, it can mean "modest" or "unassuming." On the other hand, it can also mean "pretentiously modest" or "insincere." Without more context, it is impossible to say for sure whether the speaker of the sentence is being genuinely humble or if they are being sarcastic or ironic.

If the speaker is being genuinely humble, then the sentence is likely to have a positive sentiment. However, if the speaker is being sarcastic or ironic, then the sentence is likely to have a negative sentiment.

Only with more context, such as the tone of the speaker's voice or the words and phrases that follow the sentence, can the sentiment of the sentence be accurately determined.'
