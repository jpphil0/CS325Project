He says “A hundred bucks says my octopus can play any instrument you give it!”

One man hands him an acoustic guitar. The octopus fiddles with the strings a bit, then strums out a rendition of Wonderwall.

A woman from the back hands the octopus a trumpet. The octopus fiddles with the valves, then puts the mouthpiece to its beak and plays some Louis Armstrong.

The bartender has an idea. He heads upstairs, then comes back down with bagpipes. 

The octopus takes the bagpipes, turns them over and spends about a minute tugging on the fabric.

The man, getting impatient, yells “Hurry up and play already!”

The octopus looks at him, confused. “Play?” it says, “I was trying to figure out how to get her pants off.”

I’m troubled by the large number of idle musical instruments present in a random bar.

A man and his octopus, quite smart,
Claimed it played music, a true art.
Guitar, trumpet, it showed,
But the bagpipes bestowed,
Had it thinking of a more intimate part!
I heard this on Tiktok the other day, but the ending was slightly different.

A man walks into a bar with an octopus and bets $50 his octopus can play any instrument you give him.

First man hands the octopus an accoustic guitar. 

The octopus tunes the strings, strums it a little, then plays the crowd a country song. Man with the guitar swears and pays the man with the octopus $50.

The second bar patron hands the octopus a trumpet. Octopus adjust the valves, licks its beak, and plays the crowd a jazz song. Woman with the trumpet swears and pays her $50.

Bartender, however, was watching it all with a grin and hurriedly retrieves a bagpipe from the back and hands it over, betting the man $100 that his octopus can't play it.

Octopus takes the bagpipes and throws it down and looks at it. It picks it up and flips it over and looks at it. It turns it again and keeps staring at it. It does this several times, growing more anxious each time it flips the thing over.

Bartender  crows, "ha, it can't play it. You owe me a hundred bucks."

Frustrated, the octopus owner shakes his head, not willing to lose yet.

"Hey, Frank, can you play it or not?" He shouts.

The octopus looks up in irritation.

"Play it? I'm trying to figure out how to get its pajamas off so I can f**k it."
My mom told me this years ago. Gold!
Should’ve ripped off his own penis
This is funny. I'm glad you posted it because the laugher had died down from last week when it was last posted.
*Scotland  ^sorry
Fuckin roared!
I think we should post this joke everyday as a meme
LOL!!!
I thought the joke was going  he didnt know how to play the bag pipes so he just starts banging on it, and every one claps because there no difference between good bagpipes and random nosies.
You could give it at least a week before reposting.

I FINALLY get the joke from the Simpsons where Ned Flanders talks about a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes “And the punchline implied that they FORNICATED!”
Repost from three days ago?
Quite sure I saw this here 2-3 days ago?

C'mon, even Flanders knows this joke.
Ukulele
When I first heard the punchline it was:

"Once he figures out he can't fuck it, he'll show you he can play it."

Implying that he fucked all the other instruments at some point.
Octopuses have been around for atleast 150 million years, so does this joke.
Groan!😂😂
I like how a guitar and trumpet are reasonable instruments for customers to randomly bring along, but the bagpipes are tucked away in the upstairs office.
It’s a jazz bar in Soho, everyone’s trying to get “discovered.”
Probably open mic night.  

My brother and dad both run open mic nights and often have people with random instruments sitting around waiting to play. 

Mostly guitars,  but sometimes they get spent instruments too.
Clearly the man scoped out the bar before going in with his octopus
Far superior punchline.
My version 🤣
What's with the "&#x200 B;" in between each line?
* he's a stupid joke.
Yeah, it’s a pretty old joke, there’s a lot of variations.
Whoever down voted doesn't know their marine biology. +1 for you good nerd.
For sure, no problem. 😊
He just couldn't wait... to butcher the punchline.
Okie doke.
The average octopus also can’t play instruments and talk, Andrew.
How would you play trumpet underwater?
Counterpoint, I don’t care.
Ned Flanders was raised by Beatniks, he probably knows a lot of dirty jokes.
Do you know why bagpipers walk while they play?
They’re trying to get away from the noise!
That explains it.  Thank you
What is a “spent instrument?”
His momma's so stupid it took her 9 months to make a joke.
Oooooooooh.

True tho
Actually I propose we create /r/AManWalksIntoABarWithAnOctopus
This comment made me smile most today. Thank you for that…. No… not you Andrew.
I don’t know but my girlfriend plays the flute under water 😏
They are some of my favorite characters
That was a typo I missed. My phone auto-incorrects things when I use the swiping keyboard thing. 

It was supposed to say different instruments!
Haha!!! Lolled at this, thank you
I’m a little busy these days, but you go right ahead.
Thanks!
