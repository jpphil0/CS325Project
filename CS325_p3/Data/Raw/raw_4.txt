...Turned out I was too drunk to drive that, too.

Should have taken a taxi... But I bet, almost anything, they put you in a police car...
Now I gotta try and fit this great big thing in my garage...
Did you get to Ride the Bus to the Big House?
Try an airplane next time
If you’re going to drink and drive, don’t forget your car
The bus drive was pissed when I threw him out and drove away.
If you're going to steal a bus, make sure it's a double decker... Some people wanna have a smoke.
hahaha I couldn't drive the car or the bus, I don't know what stop I was at
So he can turn on the siren to warn people out of the way. Smart thinkin
